   The Application Health Checker script is a tool for monitoring the uptime and status of a web application. It works by periodically sending HTTP requests to the application and analyzing the HTTP status codes returned. Based on the responses received, the script determines whether the application is 'up', indicating it is functioning correctly, or 'down', suggesting that it is unavailable or not responding. This script is useful for ensuring the reliability and availability of critical web applications.Assignment for AccuKnox
